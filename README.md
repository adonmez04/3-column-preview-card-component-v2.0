## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my solution page. I hope you'll find some good implemantions for this project here.

## Overview

This is my second solution to the project (the mobile first again). I got a huge feedback from Grace Snow and fixed some bugs according to them. I tried to solve some problems with responsive design. I guess this solution is a progress. I know there are lots of issues still here. I hope I can find and fix them.

I couldn't understand how to fix component size without width and height properties. Thanks to Grace, she wrote a huge comment all about this, `You will need to add more margin-top / bottom to increase the space between buttons and paragraphs once the heights have been removed.` and I got it. I should use margin and padding to set the component area. I was avoiding using margin because margin-collapse. But if I want to give some area to the item, I can use margin and padding. This will also be responsive.

## The Problems and Solutions

In this project, there is a hierarchy problem. The preview-card areas are the iteration items and all iteration items should have the same property and structure. However, the page must have at least one h1 tag. It's a clear problem that I couldn't solve. However thanks to Dave Quah's feedback, I have a solution right now.

**1 - From Dave Quah:**

I think one thing that could be improved on is the heading levels. I'd view "Sedans", "SUVs" and "Luxury" as the same heading, but I also understand that we do not want multiple `<h1>`.

I think it would be better to declare a `<h1>` but set it for screen readers only (meaning not visible but screen reader would still pick it up), and keep "Sedans" as a `<h2>` with "SUVs" and "Luxury". E.g.

// CSS

```css
.sr-only {
  position: absolute;
  top: auto;
  height: 1px;
  width: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
  white-space: nowrap;
}
```

// HTML

```html
<h1 class="sr-only">Learn more about our cars</h1>
...
<h2>Sedans</h2>
<h2>SUVs</h2>
<h2>Luxury</h2>
```

Another suggestion is that for images that are decorative, the alt should be alt="" instead of alt="#", or alternatively you could also set aria-hidden="true" to hide it from screen readers.
