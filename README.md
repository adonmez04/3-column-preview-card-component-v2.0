## Overview

This is my second solution to the project (the mobile first again). I got a huge feedback from Grace Snow and fixed some bugs according to them. I tried to solve some problems with responsive design. I guess this solution is a progress. I know there are lots of issues still here. I hope I can find and fix them.

I couldn't understand how to fix component size without width and height properties. Thanks to Grace, she wrote a huge comment all about this, `You will need to add more margin-top / bottom to increase the space between buttons and paragraphs once the heights have been removed.` and I got it. I should use margin and padding to set the component area. I was avoiding using margin because margin-collapse. But if I want to give some area to the item, I can use margin and padding. This will also be responsive.
